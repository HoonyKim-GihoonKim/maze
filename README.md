# Maze Game
To run this Maze game application, download the codes and run commands:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

I referenced generating 2D maze this site: [CodeSandbox Generate Maze](https://codesandbox.io/s/maze-game-g6vuy)

To generate 3D in 2D view, I plan to use [KONVA](https://konvajs.org/docs/react/Shapes.html)

### Demo
You can check Demo version at [Here](https://hoonykim-gihoonkim.github.io/maze/)
